# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-YouTube-data.

## Domain: Social media 

## Context and Content:
In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it announced the decision to hide the
number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to
get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen
insights from this dataset.

## Objective :
To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using numpy and pandas libraries and drive
meaningful insights by performing Exploratory data analysis.

## Data Description:
### YouTube Dislikes Dataset:
● This dataset contains information about trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021
for the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.

● This dataset contains the latest possible information about dislikes,likes,views and more which was
collected just before December 13. The information was collected by videos that had been trending in
the USA, Canada, and Great Britain for a year prior
